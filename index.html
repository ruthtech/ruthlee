                    Ruth took a career break and is returning to the workforce. 
                    Since Alex has coined the &quot;I'm Boring&quot; title, I have 
                    to come up with something else ... How about "Work is fun"?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                While I stayed at home to raise my children I kept my sanity by volunteering at their school.
                Field trips weren't enough so I branched out to applying for grants, handling social media for 
                Council, feeding 730+ kids per pizza lunch, and working with the TDSB to get the Kindergarten 
                yards fixed and playgrounds replaced. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                I've worked in or with C, C++, Java, XML, XSLT, Ant, CVS, Eclipse, Unix make files, JUnit, 
                worked with translators for translation testing, managed software development teams, project 
                managed two Eclipse projects (both archived now). There's more but I can't remember off of 
                the top of my head.
