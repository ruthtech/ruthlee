## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
A browser. Chrome was used for testing. 

### Installing
1. Go to https://github.com/ruthtech/ruthtech and click on the "Clone or Download" button. 
2. Choose "Download ZIP". 
3. Unzip into a directory. If you're on Windows, open File Explorer and navigate to the download directory. Select the ZIP file, right click, and choose "Extract All". Accept the default location.
