# Portfolio 
This is a rudimentary portfolio page for Ruth Lee.

## Getting Started
All of the files can be loaded with your browser. Copy the files to your local directory and open index.html.

### Prerequisites
A browser. Chrome was used for testing. 

### Installing
1. Go to https://github.com/ruthtech/portfolio and click on the "Clone or Download" button. 
2. Choose "Download ZIP". 
3. Unzip into a directory. If you're on Windows, open File Explorer and navigate to the download directory. Select the ZIP file, right click, and choose "Extract All". Accept the default location.
4. Once the file is unzipped, navigate to portfolio-master and use your browser to open index.html.


## Running the tests
No test suite has been created for these simple HTML and CSS files but you can check Google Chrome's Developer Tools to see if there's any syntax errors. 

## Deployment
To deploy this on a live system, copy all of the files to your server.
