This is Ruth Lee's portfolio. 

## Getting Started
All of the files can be loaded with your browser. Follow the instructions in "Installing".

### Prerequisites
A browser. Chrome was used for testing. 

### Installing
1. Go to https://github.com/ruthtech/ruthtech and click on the "Clone or Download" button. 
2. Choose "Download ZIP". 
3. Unzip into a directory. If you're on Windows, open File Explorer and navigate to the download directory. Select the ZIP file, right click, and choose "Extract All". Accept the default location.
4. Once the file is unzipped, navigate to ruthtech-master. Type "npm run build" and then "npm start". React will launch your browser on the local server. 


## Running the tests
No automated test suite has been created but you can check Google Chrome's Developer Tools to see if there are any errors.
