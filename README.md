# Portfolio

This is Ruth Lee's portfolio.

## Getting Started

First install the dependencies:

```
npm install
``` 

Then navigate to where you cloned this repository and type:

```
npm start
```

This will start the portfolio locally and launch your browser to the page. As you make changes to the JavaScript pages,
they should refresh automatically in your browser.

### Prerequisites

A browser. Chrome was used for testing.

## Running the tests

No automated test suite has been created, but you can check Google Chrome's Developer Tools to see if there are any
errors.

## Deployment

This page is built and deployed with React.

After you are satisfied with your changes, create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

Deploy it with the following command:

```
npm run deploy
```

The GitHub pages package (gh-pages) is a prerequisite of this module, and running 'deploy' publishes the 'build' folder
to the gh-pages branch. GitHub Pages then serves the updates.
