# Requirements for Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## TO DO
Recreate the portfolio using Bootstrap
1. Initial commit and setup
  1. Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`. 
  2. Add the include for the bootstrap CSS into each of the 3 files. Delete the unreferenced image file. 
  3. Create the assets directory as before. 
  4. Create this file to track the development plan. 

2. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:
  1. A navbar
  2. A responsive layout
  3. Responsive images

3. In addition, the site must meet the following requirements:
  1. Minimize the use of media queries.
  2. Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).
  3. On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

4. Submit
  1. GitHub repository with README describing the project
  2. GitHub.io pages rendering the portfolio
