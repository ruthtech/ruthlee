# Requirements for Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## TO DO
* First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to recreate your portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

  * Create the following pages: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`. Also create the assets directory as before. 

  * Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:
     * A navbar
     * A responsive layout
     * Responsive images

  * Minimize the use of media queries.
  * Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).
  * On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.
* GitHub repository with README describing the project
* GitHub repository with deployed GitHub pages
